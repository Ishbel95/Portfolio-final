    <p class="d-block text-white journey-paragraph">
       I've worked as a Special educational needs practioner for many years;
      working in schools, theatre and even educational recruitment.
       However, with myself and my partner converting a
      Horse lorry into a tiny house, I knew it was time to realise my dreams and find my passion. 
      <br /> 
      <br />
      <strong>So, I discovered 
      the wonderous world of code...</strong>
      <br /> 
      <br />
      All I could think was: <strong>'Finally! I've found my passion"</strong>
      I begun my journey into Front end development exploring Freecodecamp and Code institute. 
      I have recently graduated from 
      <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/49145-ishbel-fahey-theaker" 
      title="Ishbel SheCodes certifications"

      <a href="https://scrimba.com/dashboard#overview" 
      target="_blank" title="Scrimba Homepage">Scrimba's Frontend career Path.</a> 
      <br /> 
      <br />
      I am an extremely creative, logical and intuitive person; Frontend development marries these qualities 
      together perfectly. Learning to code has changed my life, 
      I have found my <strong>passion</strong>, my <strong>creativity<strong> 
      ,  <a href="https://github.com/Ishbel95" target="_blank" title="Ishbel Github">my code.</a>
